**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

Leveraging smart contracts to execute real estate transactions is a very intruiging subject. I find this more interesting than some of the more fundamental concepts in blockchain such as how the ledger system works because it provides a tangible way for real estate to be fundamentally changed by blockchain. With the existence of contracts for actions such as title transactions, bank loans, escrow, and title searching, the utility of smart contracts to greatly speed up and decrease cost for essential real estate processes is pretty clear.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Currently we have already reproduced last year's project on blockchain in real estate by setting up the basic transaction contract between a buyer and seller. The next steps would be to implement common systems such as escrow to handle payments by a third party. Additionally title searching is a major pain point for real estate agents because they have to pay title companies thousands every time they need to do a search. Finally, adding we would like to add loans from third parties such as banks and other institutions, these are common transactions that happen when buying real estate properties.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Currently our focus has been much more on the backend side and making sure that the contracts and test nets are set up in the most optimal way for computations. However, we want to switch approach to making a fully fledged product that non-technical people can use, especially real estate agents and other people looking to search for titles. This would mean taking a more software engineering approach and putting product design at the forefront of our development strategy. The technology serves as an outlet for what the primary need is by the users of the platform.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Currently we have been focused purely on using Ethereum and using testnets based on Ethereum. However, there are other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and even more potentially useful currencies like stablecoins. Stablecoins present a new opportunity for trusted cryptocurrency as they are pegged to existing currencies such as the US Dollar. By adding support for stablecoins, it would make the barrier to entry much easier and decrease the reluctance for new members to start using the platform in a real world setting.
